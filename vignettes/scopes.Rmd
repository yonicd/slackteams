## Overview

`slackteams` uses incoming webhook tokens to interact with the Slack API. There are two main methods to create a token.

1. Use `slackteams::add_team_interactive` to interactively create a token for the R session.
3. BYOT (Bring your own token) You are a super user or work at a company that supplied you a token. 

Each has their own pros and cons depending on what type of usage you may have

Token Type|User Level|Session Persistent|Manage Multiple Teams in Session|Store Credentials Locally|Depend on External Server
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
Interactive | All | No|Yes | No | No
BYOT  | Intermediate | Yes|No | Yes | No 

### Interactive

This is similar to oauth2 implementation you would see in [googlesheets4](https://github.com/tidyverse/googlesheets4). The steps are:

1. Call the function from the `R` console
2. Authorize the creation of the token in a browser.
3. Get redirected back to the R console.

This is by far the easiest method.

The main piece that the user controls are the [permission scopes](https://api.slack.com/scopes) the token has attached to it. To help with this we use a yaml file to allow users to define locally what scopes they want to define. {slackteams} comes with its own yaml file with the scopes that are needed to use all of `slackverse`.

**scopes**

  - `channels`:  public channels in the workspace
  - `groups`: private channels that your slack app has been added to
  - `users`: 	people in the workspace
  - `im`: direct messages that your slack app has been added to
  - `mpim`: group direct messages that your slack app has been added to
  - `emoji`: custom emoji in the workspace
  - `files`: files shared in channels and conversations that your slack app has been added to
  - `usergroups`: user groups in the workspace
  - `chat`: messages in approved channels & conversations
  - `team`: team metainformation

**permissions**

  - `write` access mean that you can post content in a scope
  - `read` access mean that you can view basic information about a scope
  - `history` access mean that you can view messages and other content in a scope

The following yaml contains a `base` role which contains only read access permissions and `slackverse` role containing permissions needed for the packages in `slackverse`. 

Click the triangle to view the scopes and the permission of each of these roles:

```{details,details.lang = 'yml',details.summary = 'Scopes',echo= FALSE}
system.file("scopes.yml", package = "slackteams")
```

The default scope is called by

```
slackteams::add_team_interactive(
  scopes = load_scopes(
    system.file("scopes.yml", package = "slackteams"),
    "base"
  )
)
```

and corresponds to

```
slackteams::add_team_interactive(scopes = load_scopes())
```

To use the `slackverse` role, use

```
slackteams::add_team_interactive(which = "slackverse"))
```

It is also possible to define custom roles. To do this, define a scopes file, for example "custom_scopes.yml", which should have scopes defined following the Slack [permission scopes](https://api.slack.com/scopes).
For example

```{details,details.lang = 'yml',details.summary = 'Custom Scopes',echo= FALSE}`
base:
  - channels:
    - read
  - users:
    - read
  - groups:
    - read
  - mpim:
    - read
  - im:
    - read
  - team:
    - read
analyze:
  - channels:
    - read
    - history
  - users:
    - read
  - groups:
    - read
    - history
  - mpim:
    - read
  - im:
    - read
    - history
  - team:
    - read
  - links:
    - read
postanalysis:
  - channels:
    - read
  - users:
    - read
  - groups:
    - read
  - mpim:
    - read
  - im:
    - write
  - team:
    - read
```
  
The resulting file can then be used, for example as 

```
slackteams::add_team_interactive(
  scopes = load_scopes("/path/to/custom_scopes.yml", which = "analyze")
)
```



### BYOT

This is useful if you:

  - Have a token that is maintained by your work slack team
  - Are an expert user and have your own incoming webhook that you maintain.
