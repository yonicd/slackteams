## Overview

`slackteams` uses incoming webhook tokens to interact with the Slack API. There are three main methods to create a token.

1. Use `slackteams::add_team_interactive` to interactively create a token for the R session.
2. Use [slackr-app](https://github.com/yonicd/slackr-app) Slack application button to create a token.
3. BYOT (Bring your own token) You are a super user or work at a company that supplied you a token. 

Each has their own pros and cons depending on what type of usage you may have

Token Type|User Level|Session Persistent|Manage Multiple Teams in Session|Store Credentials Locally|Depend on External Server
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
Interactive | All | No|Yes | No | No
slackr-app | All | Yes|Yes | No | Yes
BYOT  | Intermediate | Yes|No | Yes | No 

```{r setup,echo=FALSE}
library(slackteams)
```

### Interactive

This is similar to oauth2 implementation you would see in [googlesheets4](https://github.com/tidyverse/googlesheets4). The steps are:

1. Call the function from the `R` console
2. Authorize the creation of the token in a browser.
3. Get redirected by to the R console.

This is by far the easiest method.

The main piece that the user controls are the [permission scopes](https://api.slack.com/scopes) the token has attached to it. To help with this we use a yaml file to allow users to define locally what scopes they want to define. {slackteams} comes with its own yaml file with the scopes that are needed to use all of `slackverse`.

**scopes**

  - `channels`:  public channels in the workspace
  - `groups`: private channels that your slack app has been added to
  - `users`: 	people in the workspace
  - `im`: direct messages that your slack app has been added to
  - `mpim`: group direct messages that your slack app has been added to
  - `emoji`: custom emoji in the workspace
  - `files`: files shared in channels and conversations that your slack app has been added to
  - `usergroups`: user groups in the workspace
  - `chat`: messages in approved channels & conversations

**permissions**

  - `write` access mean that you can post content in a scope
  - `read` access mean that you can view basic information about a scope
  - `history` access mean that you can view messages and other content in a scope

The following yaml contains a `base` role which contains only read access permissions and `slackverse` role containing permissions needed for the packages in `slackverse`. 

Click the triangle to view the scopes and the permission of each of these roles:

```{details,details.lang = 'yml',details.summary = 'Scopes',echo= FALSE}
system.file("scopes.yml", package = "slackteams")
```

### Slackr-app

 <a href="https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=220157155520.220159943344&scope=incoming-webhook,files:read,files:write:user,chat:write:bot,chat:write:user,mpim:write,mpim:read,mpim:history,im:write,im:read,im:history,groups:write,groups:read,groups:history,channels:write,channels:read,channels:history,emoji:read,usergroups:read,users:read" target="_blank"><img alt="Add to Slack" height="40" width="139" src="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png" srcset="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png 1x, https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack@2x.png 2x"></a>

1. Click the button
2. Select the team to install the application
3. Select the default channel to post to (this can be changed later)
4. If successful a `SLACK_KEY_ID` will be returned. `r emo::ji('point_left')` `r emo::ji('rotating_light')` __Keep this Key__ `r emo::ji('rotating_light')`
5. If not successful an error message will be returned.
6. To keep the data safe you need your team `MEMBERID` to authenticate the `SLACK_KEY_ID`. [How to locate your Member ID](https://medium.com/@moshfeu/how-to-find-my-member-id-in-slack-workspace-d4bba942e38c)
7. Paste the output into a json file. Default path that `slackteams` looks for the file is `~/.slackteams`.

### BYOT

This is useful if you:

  - Are a [slackr](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/slackr) and have your own token in a `.slackr` dcf file
  - Have a token that is maintained by your work slack team
  - Are an expert user and have your own incoming webhook that you maintain.
